## Guiding Design Principles

This project is built following the principles of **Clean Architecture** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability. Below is an outline of the principles and their implementation in this project:

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Description**: Each module is responsible for a single concern.
- **Implementation**: [Explain which layers or modules handle UI, business logic, and data access.]

### 2. Encapsulation
- **Description**: Exposed only what is necessary in objects.
- **Implementation**: [Explain how objects' state and behavior are protected, e.g., through interfaces or access modifiers.]

### 3. Dependency Inversion
- **Description**: High-level modules depend on abstractions.
- **Implementation**: [Highlight usage of interfaces or dependency injection frameworks.]

### 4. Explicit Dependencies
- **Description**: Dependencies are clearly defined and injected.
- **Implementation**: [Explain constructor or method injections used in classes.]

### 5. Single Responsibility
- **Description**: Each module/class has one reason to change.
- **Implementation**: [Mention classes or services with focused functionality.]

### 6. DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
- **Description**: Reusable components prevent duplication.
- **Implementation**: [Reference shared libraries or utilities.]

### 7. Persistence Ignorance
- **Description**: Domain logic is independent of storage details.
- **Implementation**: [Explain use of repositories or abstraction layers.]

### 8. Bounded Contexts
- **Description**: Clear boundaries between domains.
- **Implementation**: [Describe separate contexts like modules or microservices.]
